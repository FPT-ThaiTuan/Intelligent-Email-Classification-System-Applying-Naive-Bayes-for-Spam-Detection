#### **Abstract : This project involves utilizing a cancer patient dataset to apply machine learning algorithms in predicting cancer. Machine learning offers powerful tools for identifying patterns within complex medical data, allowing for early and accurate cancer diagnoses. Key algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks, are implemented to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous cases. By training these models on relevant features like tumor size, cell structure, and other biomarkers, the study aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of cancer prediction. The results from different models are compared to identify the most effective approach, helping medical professionals make more informed decisions and offering potential insights into automated cancer screening systems.**
